SimpleOS
--------

SimpleOS is a free and open-source project for the DCPU-16 (0x10^c, 0x10c.com), created by azertyfun. The project is actually working on 0x10cdevkit 1.7.5.
There's differents solutions to try it:
- Go to http://0x10co.de/joh48, somme bugs with the keyboard
- Download the compiled.hex file (always update, so sometimes bugged), and use it with an emulator. IT MUST BE updated to the last DCPU, LEM1802 and keyboard specs.
- Download all and recompile it with 0x10c devkit 1.7.5
- Go to the downloads section, but it isn't always up-to-date.

See the wiki (https://github.com/azertyfun/SOS/wiki) if you want to create your own program.
